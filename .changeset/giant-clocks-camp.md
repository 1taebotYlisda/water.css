Added support for `prefers-color-scheme` to automatically set light and dark theme

**TODO:** Describe this more
- What are the breaking changes?
  - What is the new default theme color?
  - How does this affect them? 
- Why did we make this change?
  - Browser support means this makes sense now?
- How should consumers update their code?
  - Should they be using `water.css`, `light.css`, or `dark.css`?
